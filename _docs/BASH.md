## BASH

[BASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) (Bourne Again Shell) is a command processor for interacting with the [Linux](../Linux) kernel. It is sometimes referred to as 'the command line,' colloquially, but is really one of many possible [shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_command-line_interpreters).
