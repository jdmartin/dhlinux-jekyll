## Welcome to the DHLinux Wiki!

### Errors Ahead: Pages Currently Undergoing a Revamp - Expected Completion: June 2021

This Wiki remains a work-in-progress, and is meant to contain and extend the notes from the '[Creating LAMP Infrastructure for DH Projects](https://dhlinux.org/2019Coursepack.pdf)' course given at [DHSI](http://dhsi.org/).

Former participants of the course are welcome, and invited, to get in touch if they have an interest in adding content to these pages.
